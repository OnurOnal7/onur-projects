The character and trainer assignment involves creating and implemnting a set of NPC's that move with accordance
to the topological map created in last weeks assignment.
I created a switch --numtrainers with default value 10 to set the amount of trainers there will be in the map.
The first two trainers are always either hiker or rival and no more than 50 trainers are allowed to be placed.
The triners are stored in a dynamically allocated Cell struct array and are added
to the map by generating random indexes until an available spot is selected.
I implemented a priority queue where the top of the queue is the triner with the lowest sequence number.
The moveCharacter() function runs for the top element of the queue, popping the element each time until
the queue is empty, and then the queue is populated again with updated sequence numbers.
Hikers and rivals move the direction of a lowest cost, and the other characters move in single directions only.

In last week's assignment, I implemented my cost map without using djikstra and instead used an iterative spiral 
approach to create my cost map.
Because of this, the hiker and rival characters do not always move towards the PC, and occasionally get
stuck oscillating between two locations at the top of the map.
This is to say that although these issues appear in assignment 1.04, they occur because of a mistake made in 1.03.
