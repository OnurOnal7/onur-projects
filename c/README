The Terrian Generation problem was carried out by a primary function generate_map().
The function first sets the borders as rocks and places gates.
After generating the bounds of the map, it plants a total of six seeds of regions across the map.
It calls an algorithm that recursively grows each region turn-by-turn to conduct the initial growth phase.
Then it extraploates the larger regions into the whole map iteratively.
Next, the remaining empty spots are filled, and trees added to grass regions.
Paths are drawn from W-E and N-S exit points.
Lastly, one pokemart and one pokemon center in placed besides a random gate.
